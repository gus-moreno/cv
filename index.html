        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Gus, I was born in the USA🇺🇸, in a small town called <a href="https://www.columbusne.us/">Columbus</a> in the state of Nebraska.
          I was born on <strong>July 31, 1997</strong>, and I lived in Columbus for almost 16 years of my life.
        <p>I attended elementary school at <a href="https://www.columbuspublicschools.org/o/northparkelementary">North Park Elementary.</a></p>
        <p>After finishing elementary school I started Middle School at <a href="https://www.columbuspublicschools.org/o/columbusmiddleschool">Columbus Middle School.</a></p>
        <p>After middle school I studied for one year at <a href="https://www.columbuspublicschools.org/o/columbushighschool">Columbus High School.</a></p>
          Currently, I am a student of the <a href="https://utr.edu.mx/">Universidad Tecnológico El Retoño</a>, I'm studying TISM and I'm in my 2nd four-month-period as I type this. I am currently <strong>24</strong> years old and am curently living in Mexico🇲🇽. My plan is to go back to the <em>USA</em> when I graduate from here,
          and hopefully have a fresh start in life.
          Tomorrow will be the 21st of May of 2022, hopefully <strong>soon</strong> I will learn to be a programming god and recieve a good paying job.</p></td>
